## What?

Modifies Change:
* prevents automatic computation of impacted items (computed). Often undesired: if you manually add a core switch, this could add a lot of 'computed' items which are also impacted - which makes it less obvious to see the ones that really matter (manually added). The tab 'impact analysis' still works the same.
* adds 'reminder' field (only visible for NormalChange)

Modified NormalChange:
* allows to not specify an acceptance_comment

Modifies NormalChange, RoutineChange:
* always allow 'reject', even further in the process

Modifies EmergencyChange, NormalChange and RoutineChange:
* prevent 'title' from becoming read-only when state changes to 'implemented'
* prevent 'private_log' from becoming read-only when state changes to 'closed'
* prevent 'impact' from being mandatory
* make fallback default to 'restore from backup'
